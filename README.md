# Derayah Market Watch: A Blueprint for Modern Front-End Architecture

A professional-grade, single-page application (SPA) built to showcase a robust and scalable front-end architecture using Vue 3, Pinia, TypeScript, and the PrimeVue component library. This project serves as a comprehensive blueprint for building modern, feature-rich, and maintainable web applications.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Architectural Principles

This project was architected around three core principles that are essential for long-term scalability and maintainability.

### 1. Decoupling & Separation of Concerns

The application maintains a strict separation between its layers:

- **API Service Layer (`/services`):** All external API communication is handled here. The rest of the application is agnostic to the data source. **This layer has been enhanced to support server-side pagination.**
- **State Management Layer (`/stores`):** Pinia stores act as the single source of truth. They orchestrate business logic but delegate the "how" of data fetching to the service layer.
- **UI Layer (`/views` & `/components`):** Vue components are primarily "dumb," responsible only for displaying state and emitting user events. The PrimeVue `<DataTable>` is configured in `lazy` mode to delegate all data operations to the store.

### 2. Centralized & Scalable State Management

Global state is managed exclusively by **Pinia**. This provides a predictable and debuggable state flow. Key patterns implemented include:

- **Server-Side Pagination State:** The store now manages all state required for server-side pagination (`totalRecords`, `currentPage`, `rowsPerPage`), making the application capable of handling massive datasets with minimal initial load.
- **Advanced Paginated Caching:** A multi-key cache (`Map`) stores previously fetched pages of data. The cache key considers both the page number and the items-per-page setting (e.g., `"2-10"`), ensuring data is only fetched once and served instantly on repeat visits. This provides a massive performance boost.
- **Persistent UI State:** The store "remembers" the user's pagination state, so when they navigate away and back to the dashboard, they are returned to their exact previous position.

### 3. Automated Quality Gates

Code quality is not optional; it's automated.

- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Using **Husky** and **lint-staged**, the codebase is automatically linted and formatted before any commit can be made.
- **Unit Testing:** The core business logic in the Pinia stores is rigorously unit-tested with **Vitest**, including mocking the API service to ensure reliability in isolation.
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** The entire project runs in `strict` mode to enforce type safety and prevent common runtime errors.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Implementations

Beyond the architecture, the application includes a rich set of professional-grade features.

### User Experience

- **PrimeVue Component Library:** The entire UI is built with PrimeVue, providing a consistent, professional, and accessible design system.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** A fully implemented, theme-aware dark mode that affects all components and global styles.
- **Skeleton Loaders & Transitions:** Smooth page transitions and skeleton loaders create a fast, fluid, and modern perceived performance.
- **Global Notifications:** A decoupled **Toast** notification system handles all user feedback (errors, successes) in a non-intrusive way.
- **Confirmation Dialogs:** A promise-based confirmation service for sensitive actions like logging out.

### Functionality

- **Full Authentication:** Complete user authentication and session management using **Firebase Authentication**.
- **Protected Routes:** A robust navigation guard in `vue-router` protects authenticated routes from unauthorized access.
- **Enterprise-Grade DataTable:** The main dashboard features a PrimeVue `<DataTable>` with **lazy-loaded, server-side pagination and sorting**. This ensures the application is highly performant, even with millions of potential records.
- **Data Visualization:** The detail view includes a client-side chart using `Chart.js` to display historical price data, fetched on-demand.
